  "summary": "Diff adds a new biometric/touch-sensing records UI in the Guardian Dashboard, React Query hooks to call backend record APIs, a backend record type/state fields plus an upgrade migration, and updates Limitations & Privacy copy. However, the required backend API surface (especially delete-all) and backend-side authorization/child-profile validation are not evidenced in the provided backend diff excerpt.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Backend APIs exist to add, list, delete a specific record, and delete all records for a child profile, with guardian-only authorization and childProfileId existence/not-archived validation, and records persist across upgrades.",
      "reason": "The diff shows new state/types and a migration adding `biometricRecords` and a counter, but does not show implementation of the required public methods (especially a dedicated delete-all API), nor the required backend-side authorization checks and child existence/not-archived validation for record creation. Persistence across upgrades is implied by adding a migration module, but the actual stable-state pattern and API implementations are not visible in the truncated `backend/main.mo` excerpt.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Guardian can delete all records for a child profile via a confirmation step, wired through React Query to a backend delete-all operation.",
      "reason": "The UI includes a delete-all confirmation state, but it performs delete-all by looping and calling the single-record delete mutation repeatedly; there is no React Query hook calling a backend \"delete all records\" API, which is explicitly required (and also required at the backend per REQ-10).",
